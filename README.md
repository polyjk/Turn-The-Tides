# Turn-The-Tides
VR Game made in UNITY

This folder is primarily the script files used by the "Assets" folder in unity. These script files are written in C++/C.

Overview:
Turn The Tides is a player-versus-player game, where one person occupies VR and the other
competes against them.
The game takes place on a grid with 16 squares near the outer edge. The VR player ‘stands’
several feet above the grid in virtual space, while the non-VR player stays on the outside of the
grid on an invisible rail.
At the start of the game, all 16 tiles are ‘claimed’ by the non-VR player.
● The objective of the VR player is to hit all 16 tiles with meteors they can throw using the
Vive wand’s trigger (hold and release).
● The non-VR player is given a rapid-firing pellet gun with keyboard/mouse FPS controls.
● The objective of the non-VR player is to prevent the meteors from claiming their tiles by
hitting them with the pellet gun and changing their trajectory.
● There is a time limit of one minute.
After time runs out, the VR player wins only if he/she has claimed all 16 tiles. Otherwise, the
non-VR player wins.
